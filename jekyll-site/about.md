      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Data + Screening Tools is dedicated to making environmental justice and climate data accessible to all. We believe that providing communities, researchers, policymakers, and advocates with easy access to high-quality data tools can empower better decision-making and more effective action on environmental justice issues.</p>
      
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>We curate and provide information about the best data and screening tools available for environmental justice work. Our focus is on tools that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify communities facing disproportionate environmental and climate burdens</li>
        <li>Visualize environmental, health, and socioeconomic data in accessible ways</li>
        <li>Support policy development that advances environmental justice</li>
        <li>Help direct resources to communities that need them most</li>
        <li>Empower community-led advocacy with data-driven insights</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>We take a comprehensive approach to environmental justice data, recognizing that environmental burdens intersect with social, economic, and health factors. The tools we feature reflect this intersectional approach and draw from multiple disciplines and data sources.</p>
