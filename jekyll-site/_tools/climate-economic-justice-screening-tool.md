## Overview

The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) helps Federal agencies identify disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. These communities are at the center of President Biden's Justice40 Initiative, which aims to ensure that federal agencies deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of climate, clean energy, affordable and sustainable housing, clean water, and other investments to disadvantaged communities.

## Key Features

- Identifies disadvantaged communities based on a combination of socioeconomic, health, and environmental indicators
- Provides detailed census tract-level data
- Allows users to explore multiple categories of burden, including climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, water, and workforce development
- Interactive mapping interface with downloadable data
- Developed with input from environmental justice advocates and communities

## How to Use

1. Visit the [CEJST website](https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/)
2. Use the search function to find specific locations or browse the map
3. Click on areas to view detailed information about specific census tracts
4. Apply filters to view specific types of disadvantaged communities
5. Download data for your own analysis

## Methodology

The tool uses nationally consistent datasets to identify communities experiencing cumulative burdens. A census tract is considered "disadvantaged" if it is at or above the threshold for one or more environmental, climate, or other burdens, and is at or above the threshold for socioeconomic indicators.

## Updates and Community Feedback

The CEJST is continuously updated based on community feedback, new data, and refined methodology. The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) welcomes public input to help improve the tool and make it more useful for identifying and addressing environmental justice concerns.
