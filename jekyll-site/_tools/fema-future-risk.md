## Overview

The FEMA National Risk Index (NRI) is an online mapping application that visualizes natural hazard risk metrics. It provides a view of a community's vulnerability to natural hazards, and communities can use this data to prepare for and mitigate against disasters.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive risk assessment for 18 natural hazards at the county and census tract level
- Data on expected annual losses from natural hazards, social vulnerability, and community resilience
- Interactive mapping tool that allows for comparison across areas and hazards
- Downloadable data for further analysis and use in community planning
- Risk scores that combine hazard frequency, exposure, vulnerability, and resilience

## How to Use

1. Visit the [FEMA National Risk Index website](https://hazards.fema.gov/)
2. Navigate the map to your area of interest or search for a specific location
3. View overall risk scores or drill down into specific hazards
4. Compare risk factors across different communities
5. Download reports or data for your planning needs

## Applications

The NRI can be used for:

- Updating emergency operations plans
- Enhancing hazard mitigation plans
- Prioritizing and allocating resources
- Identifying the need for more refined risk assessments
- Encouraging community-level risk communication and engagement
- Supporting the prioritization of resilience efforts

## Limitations

The NRI is designed to provide a starting point for risk analysis but may not capture all local conditions or emerging risks due to climate change. It should be used alongside local knowledge and more detailed risk assessments when making critical decisions about hazard mitigation and community planning.
