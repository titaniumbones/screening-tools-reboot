## Overview

EPA's EJScreen is an environmental justice mapping and screening tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent dataset and approach for combining environmental and demographic indicators. EJScreen users choose a geographic area; the tool then provides demographic and environmental information for that area. All of the EJScreen indicators are publicly available data. EJScreen provides a way to display this information and includes a method for combining environmental and demographic indicators into EJ indexes.

## Key Features

- Combines environmental and demographic information to identify areas that may have higher environmental burdens and vulnerable populations
- Provides a variety of maps and reports that can be accessed online or downloaded
- Includes multiple environmental indicators such as air quality, proximity to traffic, proximity to hazardous waste sites, and more
- Demographic indicators include percent low-income, percent minority, and more
- Data is available at the Census tract and block group levels

## How to Use

1. Visit the [EJScreen website](https://ejscreen.epa.gov/)
2. Navigate to the mapping tool
3. Enter an address, city, or region to focus your analysis
4. Choose environmental indicators you wish to explore

## Limitations

EPA's EJScreen is a screening tool for pre-decisional use. It does not provide a basis for decision-making in any specific case or circumstance. EPA is sharing EJScreen to promote transparency in its work and to assist the public in developing their understanding of environmental and demographic indicators.
