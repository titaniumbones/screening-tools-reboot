## Public Environmental Data Partners

The Public Environmental Data Partners are **committed to preserving and providing public access to federal environmental data.** We are a volunteer coalition of several environmental, justice, and policy organizations, researchers across several universities, archivists, and students who rely on federal datasets and tools to support critical research, advocacy, policy, and litigation work. To gather insights on what data to preserve, we reached out to our networks, which consist largely of environmental justice groups and networks, state and local government climate offices, and academic researchers. We compiled a large list of federal databases and tools, and prioritized them based on their relative impact, our confidence that we could archive them, and the relative effort it would take to obtain and archive them.

**Fill out the form [here](https://forms.gle/qsQLgQtCUNrhVMvs7) to nominate data for us to preserve.**
